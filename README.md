This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development where `Dimensions.get()` returns `undefined` if accessed too early in the component lifecycle. The `DimensionsBug.js` file showcases the problem. The solution, implemented in `DimensionsBugSolution.js`, uses the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array to ensure the dimensions are fetched after the component has mounted and layout is complete.  This is a best practice to handle this asynchronous data retrieval.
